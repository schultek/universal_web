/// The **`Event`** interface represents an event which takes place on an
/// [`EventTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget).
///
/// An event can be triggered by the user action e.g. clicking the mouse button
/// or tapping keyboard, or generated by APIs to represent the progress of an
/// asynchronous task. It can also be triggered programmatically, such as by
/// calling the
/// [`HTMLElement.click()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click)
/// method of an element, or by defining the event, then sending it to a
/// specified target using
/// [`EventTarget.dispatchEvent()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent).
///
/// There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on
/// the main `Event` interface. `Event` itself contains the properties and
/// methods which are common to all events.
///
/// Many DOM elements can be set up to accept (or "listen" for) these events,
/// and execute code in response to process (or "handle") them. Event-handlers
/// are usually connected (or "attached") to various
/// [HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
/// (such as `<button>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, etc.) using
/// [`EventTarget.addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener),
/// and this generally replaces using the old HTML
/// [event handler attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).
/// Further, when properly added, such handlers can also be disconnected if
/// needed using
/// [`removeEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener).
///
/// > **Note:** One element can have several such handlers, even for the exact
/// > same event—particularly if separate, independent code modules attach them,
/// > each for its own independent purposes. (For example, a webpage with an
/// > advertising-module and statistics-module both monitoring video-watching.)
///
/// When there are many nested elements, each with its own handler(s), event
/// processing can become very complicated—especially where a parent element
/// receives the very same event as its child elements because "spatially" they
/// overlap so the event technically occurs in both, and the processing order of
/// such events depends on the
/// [Event bubbling and capture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_bubbling_and_capture)
/// settings of each handler triggered.
